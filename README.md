# OCC - an optical prototype without functionality

This project is for prototyping OCC with Miso.

The server part is empty at the moment but should evolve to a server mock for OCC and TC.

The client part consists of a webserver written in Haskell to serve the static content (you could use Nginx instead) and the client written in Miso/Haskell.
